Point of Care Detection Systems
This repository contains the project developed during my internship at Ubio Biotechnology Systems, focusing on the development of Point of Care Detection Systems.

# Overview
The project aims to create a test machine prototype for point of care detection. It utilizes a combination of hardware and software tools for efficient and accurate detection processes.

# Features
Test Machine Prototype: Developed using SOLIDWORKS and fabricated with a 3D printer (Ender-3 3D-Drucker).
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): Implemented using PyQt5 for intuitive user interaction.
- Image Processing: Utilizes open-source image processing tools for image detection and intensity calculation.
